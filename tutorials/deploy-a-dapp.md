# Deploy A dApp

## Overview&#x20;

The purpose of this tutorial is to help you on launching and deploying your Ethereum dApp on Bitcoin EVM.&#x20;

We have compiled a series of resources designated to help you get the basics of Bitcoin EVM and how it works, explain to you how to connect to our mainnet public ledger, and how to use an array of existing IDEs, tools, and libraries to develop and deploy on Bitcoin EVM.&#x20;

## Platform Basics ​&#x20;

is an open-source programable platform built for decentralized and enterprise-level applications, in one highly scalable.&#x20;

It is ideal for you to deploy and run your dApp, as it will present you not only with a reliable platform to do so, but an array of development tools that will help you to scale your idea. We run two public ledgers where you can deploy your dApp, Bitcoin EVM, &#x20;

Public ledgers run a fork , called go-bit, that has the networking, consensus, and console features replaced with Bitcoin EVM's equivalents, what's left being the Ethereum Virtual Machine, which runs Solidity smart contracts and manages data structures and blocks on the network.&#x20;

That means it is compatible with Ethereum dApps, as well as with its IDEs, and most wallet providers. Network Interaction Bitcoin EVM uses a subset of the Ethereum API methods, which you can explorer further in our JSON RPC Methods page, but overall, you can use all the familiar APIs and IDEs that are available on Ethereum for interacting with Bitcoin EVM. Using a Web 3 Wallet Bitcoin EVM is compatible with that supports Ethereum and allow custom networks to be added, including the widely used and Wallet applications.&#x20;

You can find more information on how to get your Web 3 wallet up and running on Bitcoin EVM in our . Using the Public APIs Instead of proxying your network interaction through a Web 3 wallet provider, you can use any official public node to call Bitcoin EVM's publicly available APIs.&#x20;

If you chose to use a public node, some API modules won't be available for security reasons. You can check on all the publicly available API call methods in our , or if your application requires modules that are not publicly accessible, you can to use them. Running a Local Test Network You can run your own instance of Bitcoin EVM for development and testing purposes. For that you can download and install our publicly available versions of either go-phi or go-divine in your local machine.&#x20;

Developing and Deploying Contracts Being compatible with Ethereum, most development tools available for Ethereum will also be compatible with Bitcoin EVM. A list of the most used IDEs to deploy smart contracts below: ​​ ​​ ​​&#x20;

You can also use any Solidity-compatible IDE to write, develop, and integrate your smart contracts with your decentralized application written in Javascript, Typescript, VUE, etc. The most common IDEs used by us to develop our Bitcoin EVM-compatible applications are the and .&#x20;

[Bitcoin EVM Explorer](https://explorer.bitcoinevm.com) If you are deploying in one of our public ledgers, you will be able to use our officially supported block explorer to index and pull blockchain data.&#x20;

Contract Function Calls You don't have to verify your contract to call its functions on Bitcoin EVM.&#x20;

You can upload your contract's ABI code, specify its network address, and call its functions.
